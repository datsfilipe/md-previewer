# Markdown Previewer

This binary helps you preview markdown files in the web with reloading support while watching for changes.

## Usage

```sh
md-previewer --file=path/to/file.md
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add custom css for the previewer
- [X] Find a way to show the assets in the previewer (like images and so on that user added in the markdown)
- [ ] Create the plugin integration for Neovim

Any other enhancements are welcome too :0
